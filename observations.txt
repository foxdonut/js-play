Problems with badSave

- doesn't wait for saving orders to finish before saving diagnosis

Problems with save

- works, but using promises means having to create fake/empty promises when
  we don't need to save

Nice things about generators

- can write one function call after another even if async
- can call yield, or not, which solves the fake/empty promise problem.
